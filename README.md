A little program to make installing sir [atacms's UML mod](http://forum.worldoftanks.eu/index.php?/topic/457839-11000universal-model-loader-uml-change-only-the-appearance-of-your-own-tank/) a bit simpler. To compile your own version, run this from the base directory:

```
# generating catalog file
python catalog_maker.py
# generate the exe
TODO Added py2exe generation process
```

Still lack a bunch of features:
	[] Automatic detection of WG game location
	[] Persistent mods between game version (new version will redownload mods from github)

All credits goes to respective authors who published their own mod on github and made them compatible to UML.
